# Surface GO 11 ISO
A windows 11 iso for Microsoft Surface Go 1st edition with 128GB ssd with all drivers.


This iso is wasnt tested yet. 
You take all responsibilities if something goes wrong. I do not take any liability for any damage to your device.

This iso is only for version that has 128GB ssd, because 64GB has different storage type.

After install. There is gonna pop up a powershell window that will isntall all the drivers onto the new system. The iso installation should support all functions of the Surface Go (usb, touch, etc..).
If install of drivers will fail, there are inf files in the iso (\sources\$OEM$\$1\Drivers).
If some drivers arent gonna work, im sorry for that. I took them from my current Surface Go.

With all that. Good luck!
